#bio
  %h2 Bio
  Once upon a time I was a freelance designer. I was given an illegal copy of photoshop when I was nine, and instantly fell in love with it. Through that piece of pirated software I eventually taught myself design, branding, color, layout, and other principles. When it came time for college, I sought to diversify and study computer science rather than the natural path of continuing with design. Through both of these skills I'm able to bring an idea from imagination to a working piece of elegantly designed software in days.

          The coolest role by far. Worked with an agile team in San Francisco who partenered with startups in the area to propose, design, and build protoypes of ideas with a targetted ship date of 2025. Helped build Microsoft's roadmap for far-reaching projects and non-standard interaction methods. Did predictive analysis of the market, environment, hardware, and software capabilities at five year, ten year, and twenty year marks. Designed UIs and interaction models for wearable technology and large-format full-wall screens (10 feet plus).

          Worked on integrating the latest data offerings of Bing services into the existing products (maps, search, cortana). Made further Cortana prototypes showing off alternate UI interactions and flows with a digital companion. Did 3D map UI testing and created interaction models. Helped create the new 3D version of photosynth and prototyped real-time 3d environment scanning UIs.

    Developer. Created a ruby on rails ship tracking platform for all ships, submarines, planes, and other mobile objects in the Pacific that would incorporate real world news feeds in order to best predict which ships were in the most amount of danger at any given time. Also did real time traffic analysis of all data being sent between ships in order to detect anomalies/intrusions.

    then hired artists to draw out three separate stories. After finding that the performance of the html5 implementation of the book would not run at acceptable framerates on mobile devices, hired developers to create native IOS, Android, and Windows versions of the parallax engine according to spec. Due to having to create separate implementations of each book (instead of creating one html5 based one and releasing on all platforms at once), changed the business model from the original, free and donation supported model to a paid one.
