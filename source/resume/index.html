    <h2>Bio</h2>
    Once upon a time I was a freelance designer. I was given an illegal copy of photoshop when I was nine, and instantly fell in love with it. Through that piece of pirated software I eventually taught myself design, branding, color, layout, and other principles. When it came time for college, I sought to diversify and study computer science rather than the natural path of continuing with design. Through both of these skills I'm able to bring an idea from imagination to a working piece of elegantly designed software in days.

        <i>Aug 2007 - Feb 2011</i><br/>
        Developer. Created a ruby on rails ship tracking platform for all ships, submarines, planes, and other mobile objects in the Pacific that would incorporate real world news feeds in order to best predict which ships were in the most amount of danger at any given time. Also did real time traffic analysis of all data being sent between ships in order to detect anomalies/intrusions.

    <h2>Personal Projects</h2>
    <p>
        <h3>Children's Books</h3>
        Worked on creating digital books for children. Created <a href="http://files.jjcm.org/book/">several working prototypes in html/javascript as a proof of concept</a>, then hired artists to draw out three separate stories. After finding that the performance of the html5 implementation of the book would not run at acceptable framerates on mobile devices, hired developers to create native IOS, Android, and Windows versions of the parallax engine according to spec. Due to having to create separate implementations of each book (instead of creating one html5 based one and releasing on all platforms at once), changed the business model from <a href="http://non.io">the original, free and donation supported model</a> to a paid one. The first book is expected to be released in the IOS app store pending Apple approval.
